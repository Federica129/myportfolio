        <p>
       Hi everyone! My name is Federica Schillaci, I'm 23 years old and I was born and live in Palermo (Sicily).<br>
       I'm a quite,sunny and a little shy girl that loves making new friends, go out and learn new things!<br>
       After high school, I did my first work experiences in the world of retail where I improved my skills (in particulary) in the customers contact.
       <br>In March 2020, in Italy they closed the activities due to COVID for 3 months.. and here I known, studied, played as a pastime for the first time HTML/CSS; 
       after that period, I continued to do other even if with my curiosity to learn more about it.
       <br>Today I decided to follow a course of study thanks to <a class="linktext" href="https://edgemony.com/">Edgemony</a> that allows me to learn programming languages to be a day a web developer.
        </p>

            <h4>SALES ASSISTANT</h5>
            <h5>May 2021 - October 2021</h5>

          <p>
            Sales Assistant at the store "CROFF" (OVS s.p.a.) in a street of
              Palermo.<br>
              My duties were: Assisting customers during their choice of
              products to buy; arrangement and replacement of goods, shop and
              cashier management.<br>
              During this experience, since I learned fast, I worked in three
              other locations due to need of staff e.g Upim, improving myself.
              <br>
              The same agency offered some training courses about our security
              at work, fire prevention (low risk) and the new European
              legislation on privacy.
